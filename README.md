Parse (http://parse.com) is hiring and just for the sake of the exercise I've implemented in Ruby the POST procedure they specified in their page https://www.parse.com/jobs/apply.

1. Download aparse.rb and aparse.cfg
2. Fillout aparse.cfg with your own information (find below an example)

> name:  John Doe
> email: john.doe@example.com
> about: Designer and developer interested in search engines, information extraction from unstructured sources and data mining
> urls:  www.example.com | www.example2.com | www.example3.com

3. Execute the program

         ruby aparse.rb

Enjoy. Please feel free to contact me if you find any problem.
